## **Introduction**  

In higher education, identifying students at risk of dropout is a critical challenge. Early intervention can significantly improve academic success rates, reduce student attrition, and support institutional decision-making. The dataset chosen for this project, *"Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success,"* originates from a Portuguese higher education institution and includes comprehensive data about students' academic performance, demographics, and socioeconomic factors.

The primary objective of this project is to **predict student outcomes**—whether they will **drop out**, remain **enrolled**, or successfully **graduate**—by leveraging machine learning techniques. This problem is framed as a **multi-class classification task** with three categories:

- **Dropout (0)**  
- **Enrolled (1)**  
- **Graduate (2)**

### **Key Project Goals**  

1. Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure it is ready for analysis.  
2. Performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify feature relationships and trends.  
3. Addressing **class imbalance** to ensure fair model predictions.  
4. Building and evaluating machine learning models, including:  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - Neural Networks  
5. Drawing data-driven conclusions and providing actionable insights to reduce student dropout rates and improve academic outcomes.
